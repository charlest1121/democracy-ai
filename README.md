# Democracy.ai

Democracy.ai simplifies ongoing legislation using GPT-4 AI & NLP, making it accessible to the public. The platform extracts key info from documents and presents it in a user-friendly interface. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and custom-trained GPT-4.

## Project Goals

The following goals outline the initial steps to establish the Democracy.ai platform:

1. **Design a responsive user interface:** Create a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate UI for users to access and understand legislation summaries.

2. **Develop a basic frontend:** Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the frontend, ensuring it is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

3. **Implement a backend framework:** Set up a server and database to store and manage legislative documents and summaries.

4. **Integrate GPT-4 AI model:** Develop a custom-trained GPT-4 model for summarizing legislation and integrate it into the platform.

5. **Create an API for data retrieval:** Design an API to fetch and display legislative summaries from the backend to the frontend.

6. **Establish user authentication:** Implement a user authentication system to enable personalized features, such as saving favorite summaries or tracking specific legislation.

7. **Testing and quality assurance:** Ensure the platform's reliability and accuracy by conducting thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

8. **Launch a beta version:** Release an early version of the platform for public testing and feedback, which will help identify areas for improvement and new features to add.

9. **Community engagement:** Encourage users to provide feedback, report issues, and contribute to the project's development through open-source collaboration.

10. **Iterative development:** Continuously improve the platform based on user feedback, performance metrics, and new legislative data
